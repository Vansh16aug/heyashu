# About the Creator (The Boss, Akshay Saini)

Akshay started building websites in the 7th or 8th grade.

He has worked at Paytm, Uber, [Lendingkart](https://www.lendingkart.com/business-loan/check-eligibility), and multiple startups, where he learned how to develop large-scale companies.

He started a startup while he was still in college.

Multiple things have helped him in his career; one of those is  \`Being Curious\`.

Having curiosity and the desire to learn new things will help you become better and better.

He encourages you to be curious during this course as well.
